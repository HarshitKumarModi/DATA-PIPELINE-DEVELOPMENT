# ETL Pipeline Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline using Python. It loads a CSV file (`raw_data.csv`), processes the data by handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical features, and then saves the clean data to `processed_data.csv`.
